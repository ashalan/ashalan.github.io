<p>Hello, I am Amer. I am a web developer turned data scientist. I do not specialize in any specific field. If I think something is cool, I will work on discovering more about it. Come with me on this data science adventure.</p>

<p>Thoughts shared here are just things I find interesting or cool stuff I'm working on. It should not be taken as absolute science, there is always the chance that I did things wrong, so bear with me as I grow through this blog.</p>

<p>Hope you like my work and feel free to <a href='/contact'>get in touch</a> with me :)</p>
