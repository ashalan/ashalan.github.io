<p>The cycling4gaza team approached me to redesign their website to give it a more modern feel.</p>

<p>The first thing to figure out was what their stack was built on. After some investigation I figured out it was built on wordpress. Something I had no experience in. Time to learn!</p>

<p>It turns out wordpress is a very simple php app. Luckily they already had a child theme set up. Which it turns out is the wordpress way to override a theme. I just had to copy and paste some php template files and modify them. However I did not want to add any hardcoded things into the templates. Time to break out some googling about adding theme customization. You need to add a variable the custom register on your theme. To do that you can add actions in your themes functions.php file as shown below.</p>

<pre>
function standard_child_customize_register( $wp_customize ) {
   //All our sections, settings, and controls will be added here
    $wp_customize->add_section( 'standard_child_header_title' , array(
        'title'      => __( 'Header Title', 'standard_child' ),
        'priority'   => 50,
    ) );
    $wp_customize->add_setting( 'header_title' , array(
        'default'   => 'This is a title!',
        'transport' => 'refresh',
    ) );
    $wp_customize->add_control(
        'title_header', 
        array(
            'label'      => __( 'Header Title', 'standard_child' ),
            'section'    => 'standard_child_header_title',
            'settings'   => 'header_title',
            'type'     => 'textarea',
        )
    );
}
add_action( 'customize_register', 'standard_child_customize_register');
</pre>

<p>Then you can add a simple h1 to your theme file and import the theme modification built above.</p>
<pre>
<h1 class="header-title"><?php echo get_theme_mod('header_title'); ?></h1>
</pre>
<p>This makes it incredibly easy to modify your theme as shown in this picture below</p>
